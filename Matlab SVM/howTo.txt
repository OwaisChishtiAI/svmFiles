As per your wish, I have compile files in one Main.m program.

1) Run <data = getFederalistData> in shell then,
2) Run <final = Main(data)>
You'll get SVM boundary image automatically and it also prints compare matrix to compare
your Test values and predicted results.

variable "final" has all you want.
final = {
	X,
	y,
	Ytest,
	biases, weights,
	output_predictions,
	compare or confusion matrix}
